# Simple-Switch-On-Timer

First of all, let me thank @dennypage for allowing me to extend the functionality of his great "Simple Switch Off Tiimer".


This application provides a simple switch timeout system for turning off switches that have been left on. Sometimes people refer to this as an "Egg Timer".

This isn't anything you cannot accomplish with Rule Machine, but it's a lot easier to manage, especially if you have dozens of them.
